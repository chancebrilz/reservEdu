Booking a Reservation (SYSTEM TESTING):
  The client logs in, if an account exists, else client registers.
  After the log in is successful, the user selects the facility to reserve
  After a facility has been reserved, the user picks the date and time from 
    the available slots
  The facility request will be updated and pushed into the queue for checkout
  The user is prompted to enter the necessary information, only user information
  Then the user is prompted to enter the payment information
  Payment is handled by stripe
  After the payment is validated, the receipt is displayed to the user
  Also an email is sent to the user and the DOE of the receipt.
  
The steps above show how well the classes for the user side work together,
  if there is an error at any point or unsuccessful reservation after following 
  the guidelines then the system testing has failed.
  
  
School Activation and Managing Reservation/Facility (SYSTEM TESTING):
  The school would register in the site using the specific code provided and log in.
  After activation, the school can manage their profile. It is highly recommended to
    add a picture and a description before adding facilities.
  School adds facilities and times available for the usage of the facilities.
  School then promotes the facilities using social media features as share in facebook, etc.
  *Schools can return at any point to add more facilities in the same fashion* (Can be done at any time)
  School can return to manage reservation or facilities with the same steps, following the GUI
  
The steps above show sample usage of the site to portray how well the classes work together. 
If any issues arise at any step then the system test fails. For example, following correct steps,
schools cannot be activated with their unique code, or schools cannot manage facilities or reservations
using the correct steps.
